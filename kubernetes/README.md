## Installing Kubernetes

This folder contains scripts for installing Kubernetes.

## Precautions

The current version of Kubernetes is v1.12.2.

This version recommends Docker version 18.06 and may not run in the higher version.

We used the Raspbian operating system to install Kubernetes on Raspberry Pie 3.
